**SMS Spam Detection**
In this SMS Spam Detection project, we tackle the problem of filtering unsolicited spam messages by employing machine learning modelsâ€”Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes. With spam posing both privacy risks and message clutter, an effective automated solution is crucial. SVM seeks to maximize the separation margin between spam and non-spam messages, making it robust for text classification, while Naive Bayes, a probabilistic classifier, efficiently predicts spam likelihood based on word frequency. Through comparing these models on key metrics like accuracy and precision, we aim to identify the most effective approach, enhancing communication safety by minimizing spam in SMS inboxes.
